<h3> <strong> Project Concept </strong> </h3>
<p>Hello World! We are creating an application that will recommend grocery stores around you with cheapest price of a searched food item.</br></br>
Since it is challenging to find the dataset of grocery store rates, we are intially creating an application which will let the customer to input
their grocery store name, shopping list and item prices while shopping.<br></br>
This way we will collect and create our own dataset which we will use to create a dashboard of live rates across vatious stores in a city </p>

<h3><strong> Stakeholders </strong></h3>
<p> Grocery stores, Users(Students and common public), Restaurant Owners, Event hosts, software developers </p>

<h3><strong> User Stories: Milestone 1.0<strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Users will create and login details and with current location/address : 5 days</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Create Welcome page</li>
