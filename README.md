<h3> <strong> Project Concept </strong> </h3>
<p>Hello World! We are creating an application that will recommend grocery stores around you with cheapest price of a searched food item.</br></br>
Another idea we have is of creating an application that will suggest food items on the restaurant menu, below $10, around you.</br></br>
And if we cannot find sufficient data for above projects we would create an application <strong><i>'Around ME!'</i></strong>, that would
suggest events happening around you in a city, events like restaurant happy hours,concerts,places to see/visit and things to do with their details.
In this application the restaurant owners or event hosts can also input data to keep the list updated and to get events that are not displayed anywhere else.</p>
